    description: `<b>My level:</b> Advanced <br />I learned <b>C</b> during my bachelors at Tehran University on 2015.
     I created a simple pacman game with only C as the final project. <br /> During Electronic Systems Object-Oriented Simulations module 
     I used <b>C++</b> to create an application to distinguish obejcts from eachother on 2019. On March 2023, I finished a Udemy course called 
     "The Unreal Arsenal: Learn C++ and Unreal Engine" in which I learned intermediate and advanced subjects about C++ and also code a project 
     in C++ in Unreal Engine. I also finished a module during my masters called "Object-Oriented Programming in C++". In this module, I reviewed
      all the important topics in C++ and object oriented programming. Also, in Advanced Games Technology module I code a complete level of a game
      only using C++. I coded 3D math problems using C++. I feel pretty confident code in C++.

    and since then I worked for differen companies until 2023 and I got involved in different projects. Therefore, I can say I have more than three years
    of expreince with JavaScripts.

  p1: "Hi, it's Soroush!",
  p2: "I <b>love programming</b>! I can sit and <b>solving problems</b> and coding for hours. I always pay <b>attention to the details</b> and enjoy seeing the final awesome application. I have experience with a huge stack of programming languages, but I tried to limit myself to <b>C++/C#</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, and sometimes <b>Python</b>. I'll never stop learning new things.",
  p3: "I've worked as a professional software engineer (employed and freelance) <b>over 3 years</b> with focus mainly on web application and I've followed my other passion which is <b>game programming</b> meanwhile. I've worked with different teams and managed to <b>communicate effectively</b>. ",
  p4: "I learned the <b>Unreal Engine</b> in University and by self studying. I created some games using this engine.",
  p5: "I completed my bachelor's in Electrical Engineering in 2019, and now I'm studying <b>Master's in Computer Games Technology</b> with an expected finish date in 2024",
  p6: "a software engineer eager about game development. I worked as a software engineer in different teams in the tech industry for about 2 years. I’m currently studying for a master’s in computer games technology with an expected end date of August 2024. The focus of my course is on C++ programming and learning the essential math skills to build high-quality games, I’ve also completed an in-depth Udemy course on C++ and Unreal engine, therefore I have a robust understanding of C++. Based on my experience I can learn new programming languages fast and can easily understand and work on top of others’ codes. Also, I’m comfortable using company-specific engines to build a game as I did in my course. On top of that, I’m working on the game engine  we used at the university and improving it. I have had a passion  for games from a young age and Now I can’t wait to face new challenges in game programming.",
