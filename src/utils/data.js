  p1: "Hi, it's Soroush!",
  p2: "I <b>love programming</b>! I can sit and <b>solving problems</b> and coding for hours. I always pay <b>attention to the details</b> and enjoy seeing the final awesome application. I have experience with a huge stack of programming languages, but I tried to limit myself to <b>C++/C#</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, and sometimes <b>Python</b>. I'll never stop learning new things.",
  p3: "I've worked as a professional software engineer (employed and freelance) <b>over 3 years</b> with focus mainly on web application and I've followed my other passion which is <b>game programming</b> meanwhile. I've worked with different teams and managed to <b>communicate effectively</b>. ",
  p4: "I learned the <b>Unreal Engine</b> in University and by self studying. I created some games using this engine.",
  p5: "I completed my bachelor's in Electrical Engineering in 2019, and now I'm studying Master's in Computer Games Technology with an expected finish date in 2024",
  p6: "a software engineer eager about game development. I worked as a software engineer in different teams in the tech industry for about 2 years. I’m currently studying for a master’s in computer games technology with an expected end date of August 2024. The focus of my course is on C++ programming and learning the essential math skills to build high-quality games, I’ve also completed an in-depth Udemy course on C++ and Unreal engine, therefore I have a robust understanding of C++. Based on my experience I can learn new programming languages fast and can easily understand and work on top of others’ codes. Also, I’m comfortable using company-specific engines to build a game as I did in my course. On top of that, I’m working on the game engine  we used at the university and improving it. I have had a passion  for games from a young age and Now I can’t wait to face new challenges in game programming.",
