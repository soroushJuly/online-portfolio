  p1: "Hi, it’s Soroush!",
  p2: "I’m a software engineer eager about game development. I worked as a software engineer in different teams in the tech industry for about 2 years. I’m currently studying for a master’s in computer games technology with an expected end date of August 2024. The focus of my course is on C++ programming and learning the essential math skills to build high-quality games, I’ve also completed an in-depth Udemy course on C++ and Unreal engine, therefore I have a robust understanding of C++. Based on my experience I can learn new programming languages fast and can easily understand and work on top of others’ codes. Also, I’m comfortable using company-specific engines to build a game as I did in my course. On top of that, I’m working on the game engine  we used at the university and improving it. I have had a passion  for games from a young age and Now I can’t wait to face new challenges in game programming.",
